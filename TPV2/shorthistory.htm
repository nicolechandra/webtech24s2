	<h3> Short Hisory of Matcha </h3>
    <p> The common perception that matcha originates from Japan is a misconception. In reality, the origins of matcha can be traced back to China in the 12th century. It was introduced to Japan by the Japanese Buddhist monk Myoan Eisai, who discovered its beneficial effects on meditation, noting that it fostered a sense of calm alertness. This discovery was made during his studies in China, and upon realizing the potential of matcha, Eisai brought the tea seeds to Japan. He planted these seeds on temple grounds upon his return, specifically at the residence of the Kamakura Shogunate, marking the beginning of matcha's cultivation in Japan. Eisai's innovative techniques, such as growing tea leaves in shaded conditions, were pivotal in enhancing the health benefits associated with matcha.
        The word "matcha" is deeply rooted in the Japanese language, deriving from "matsu" (to rub or to paint) and "cha" (tea). This reflects the unique and meticulous preparation process of matcha, which involves grinding tea leaves into a fine powder.
        Historically, the Tang Dynasty (7th to 10th century) pioneered the practice of steaming tea leaves and then forming them into bricks for easier transport and storage. This method involved roasting and then crushing the leaves into a powder, which was later mixed with water and salt. Eisai's introduction of tea seeds to Japan and his cultivation methods signified a pivotal moment in the history of tea, particularly in the evolution and popularization of matcha, emphasizing its cultural and health significance that persists to this day.
