    Once in a while, I think about this drink. I don’t know if it’s the branding, the presentation, or the ambiance and
    the entire experience of having this matcha, but it feels like a sunny, warm day. I would not say that the matcha
    itself is life changing or anything, but everything else surrounding it just seems to support it. The first sip
    feels very light, yet the subtle matcha flavor hits in the aftertaste. Because it is so light, it is almost watery,
    and depending on how I feel that day, I can either love it or hate it. The price, due to the company’s superb
    branding I must say, is quite expensive, but you gotta live a little sometimes. It is the perfect drink to regain
    focus and zen, pull up your laptop, and have a super productive day.

    <h2> Matcha Maiko </h2>

    <h3> Cheese Foam Matcha Latte</h3>

        I ordered the cheese latte thinking that it will be a good balance of bitter and sweet. I loved the creamy blend
        of
        the latte and the matcha. However, it was a little too sweet for my liking. Matcha has a naturally bitter taste
        so
        if you top it with milk AND cheese, it takes a heavier twist to the mouth, leaving a unique aftertaste of bitter
        and
        sweet. They definitely added more flavor drops or sweeteners, but it didn't overpower the bitter taste of
        matcha. In terms of pricing, this was definitely more to the pricier end, especially for a medium cup. I think
        this would be perfect for matcha beginners or those who don’t really enjoy the raw bitterness of matcha!
        Overall, it was very creamy yet refreshing.

    <h2> Tatte </h2>

    <h3> Iced Matcha Latte </h3>

    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        My first impression of the matcha was, “Oh, that is a very light… green.” I’ve always thought that a generous
        amount
        of matcha would reach a point where the drink looks dark enough, but not too dark; dark, but vibrant green. More
        so
        than the color, it often speaks to the quality of the drink which I explain in “Why Ceremonial Grade Matcha?”
        Although the drink was bitter, the taste of the milk overpowered everything else. However, I love that they
        don’t
        add any extra sugars, so people can adjust the sweetness to their own liking. As for me, I really enjoyed how
        light
        and refreshing this drink is and despite them being heavier on the milk ratio, it still felt energizing and
        delicious!

        I really enjoyed this matcha. This latte has a very grassy note, followed with a pleasant bitterness and a
        lingering sweetness at the end. While they offer both sweetened and unsweetened versions, I ordered the
        unsweetened. You can tell a good matcha just by ordering the original flavor, and this was definitely it. Also,
        bonus points for the cool latte art! I came here during the weekend, so they were really busy and couldn’t make
        animal art. So, come during the weekdays! They will be able to make cute little rabbits, hearts, and animal
        shaped foam latte art that you can post on your Instagram stories.

<h2> Machi Machi </h2>

<h3> Panna Cotta Iced Matcha Latte </h3>

    For a price like this, one would expect for the taste of matcha to be more prominent. However, this was very heavy
    on the sweetness that it overwhelms the taste of matcha. However, the matcha had grassy undertones after the sip,
    but the panna cotta adds a unique addition to the flavor and texture of the drink. Because you have to chew a little
    bit of the panna cotta, it leaves a “heavier” finish compared to other lattes, but I would recommend this to those
    who are just starting out to like matcha, or could enjoy matcha with boba and other topping options.
