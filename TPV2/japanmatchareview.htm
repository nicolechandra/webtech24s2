    I could write a book about this. THE MATCHA TOKYO sets a high bar for what Matcha latte is supposed to taste like.
    These are also one of the few stores that traditionally whisk the matcha in front of the customers to see, allowing
    full transparency into the creation of the drink. What makes this drink stand out? It is the rich umami flavor
    without any trace of bitterness or astringency. You can tell that the sourcing of these tea leaves goes through a
    meticulous process, also just by how the Matcha froths seamlessly, leaving a delicate foam layer on top. This
    quality is uncompromised even after the milk is poured, all because of the fine Matcha powder that it guarantees the
    smoothest sip. This drink is for matcha lovers to beginners alike. It is a luxurious, delicious experience for
    everyone. I don’t remember how many times I walked out of the hotel just to buy this drink. It is the BEST THING
    EVER.

    You might be asking why one would order at Starbucks in Japan. In all honesty, the starbucks was decorated very
    nicely which was very attractive to me as a tourist coming in the spring (everything was pink!). As a result, I
    stepped in to order the matcha latte. To my
    surprise, there is a size smaller than the “tall” size that I was accustomed to– “short.” While this was a small
    drink, I could immediately taste the strong matcha flavor. However, it was slightly overpowered by some sweetness. I
    wanted to believe that the Starbucks in Japan would be different than the one I usually got at the U.S, but in all
    honesty, it was just a much more elevated version of the U.S matcha, as in it tastes more “authentic” in a way where
    there is more bitterness, but not enough for it to balance with the sweetness. For the price, I would say that this
    is
    pretty reasonable, especially for a size this small.

    <h3> Hot Matcha Tea </h3>
    <img src="authenticmatcha.jpg" alt="Authentic Matcha Picture" title="Authentic Matcha Image">
    <ul>
        <li> Location: ZEX SHIROKANE 1F, 6-16-41 Shirokane, Minato-ku, Tokyo
            <ol>
                <li> Price: ¥14,800 YEN / $97.73 USD </li>
                <li> Note: This price is part of a complete Omakase dinner. </li>

    This matcha was the definition of “authentic.” When the drink arrived, I immediately noticed how it was served
    straight off the “Chawan” it was whisked from, indicating the precise effort it took to create the drink by hand. I
    took a sip and felt the umami taste and the perfect blend of slight bitterness and savory tones. The creamy texture
    from the foam, whisked by the bamboo stick, proves the quality of the matcha and its freshness. Because it offers a
    ore vibrant green color, it introduces the delicate flavor profile that is unique and rare to be found anywhere
    else. Not only was the omakase excellent, topping it off with sweets (the sorbet shown on the top left of the
    screen) perfectly complemented the bitterness of the matcha.
