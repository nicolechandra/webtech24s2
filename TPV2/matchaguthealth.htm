	<h3> Gut Health</h3>
	<p>Catechins, a class of antioxidant that helps shield the body—including the gut—from oxidative stress and
		inflammation, are abundant in matcha. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a particularly strong catechin found in
		matcha, has been investigated for its ability to promote digestive health and shield the lining of the
		gastrointestinal tract (National Library of Medicine).
	</p>

	<h3> How Matcha Helped My Digestion</h3>
	<p>
		As I mentioned in the <a href="index.htm"> About Me </a> page, I grew up with an unhealthy obsession with
		coffee. It was until I found matcha that I realized how it has contributed to my overall health and appearance.
		From skin texture to bowel movements, I felt physically more energetic because I started cutting coffee and
		replacing it with my new favorite drink instead. As a result, I returned to the doctor and he told me how much
		better my sugar level regulations are. As I grew into womanhood, matcha also helped regulate my hormones and
		manage abdominal cramps, bloating, and even mood swings. Perhaps it is the “peaceful” aspect that comes along
		with its rich history, but its health factor also plays a huge role in contributing to one’s health– both
		physically and mentally.
