    <h3> Modernized Matcha</h3>
    <p>
        Going back to my story on how I discovered matcha, it is so interesting to see how other people have grown and
        discovered matcha on their own. Influencers are beginning to promote its health benefits, even creating their
        own brands and claiming it to be “ceremonial grade” and “organic.” I have my own opinions on this: these terms
        don’t mean anything as far as quality goes. Just because you label these as “organic” or “ceremonial grade,”
        matcha in itself already has health benefits that act as the default, so claims such as these make me wonder:
        what other things may these influencers be emphasizing that is not already in matcha? Food for thought.
        For example, I recently discovered Emma Chamberlain’s company, Chamberlain Coffee.

    <p>
        Although Emma has reinvented how people can make matcha at the comfort of their own home, the ever-evolving
        ritual of matcha is constantly changing. Now, Matcha has become a “hollywood” trend that is inspired by hashtags
        such as the #itgirlaesthetic or the #cleangirl lifestyle. Although often associated with health and “fit”
        lifestyles, some influencers use this opportunity to capitalize on their brand image. At the same time, I am
        glad that matcha is getting the recognition it deserves. However, I hope people are more conscious in their
        choice of purchase, ensuring that these are ethically sourced with respect to its roots and tradition.
