  <h1 id="h11">More About Tigers (+)</h1>
  <p id="p1">
    In the past, tigers were found throughout Asia, from the Caucasus and the Caspian Sea to Siberia and the Indonesian
    islands of Java, Bali and Sumatra.
    Fossil remains indicate tigers were also present in Borneo and Palawan in the Philippines during the late
    Pleistocene and Holocene.[74][75]
    During the 20th century, tigers became extinct in western Asia and were restricted to isolated pockets in the
    remaining parts of their range.
    They were extirpated on the island of Bali in the 1940s, around the Caspian Sea in the 1970s, and on Java in the
    1980s. This was the result of
    habitat loss and the ongoing killing of tigers and tiger prey. Today, their fragmented and partly degraded range
    extends from India in the west
    to China and Southeast Asia. The northern limit of their range is close to the Amur River in southeastern Siberia.
    The only large island they
    still inhabit is Sumatra.[1] Since the beginning of the 20th century, tigers' historical range has shrunk by 93%. In
    the decade from 1997 to 2007,
    the estimated area known to be occupied by tigers has declined by 41%.[2][76]
