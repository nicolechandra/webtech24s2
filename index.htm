	<h2> About Me </h2>
	<p>
		 My name is Nicole Chandrawidjaja and I grew up in the tropical country of Indonesia. Currently, I am navigating the academic journey as a sophomore at<a href="http://www.babson.edu" target = "_blank"> Babson College </a>, with my sights set on a future where I merge my passions with my profession. My career aspirations lie at the crossroads of Marketing and Operations, specifically in the dynamic realms of media, entertainment, and game design. Growing up, video games and movies weren't just pastimes; they were a portal to countless worlds and stories, shared in the company of my brothers. This early love for digital storytelling sparked a deep-seated curiosity in me about the magic that unfolds behind the scenes in film and game production. Driven by this fascination, I am eager to immerse myself in the creative process, where ideas spring to life and narratives are woven, shaping the future of entertainment and gaming.

	<h2> My Hobbies</h2>
	<p>
		Some of my hobbies include hanging out with my friends and family, karaoke, traveling, and cafe hopping. I have always wanted to explore the best cafes around Boston, and I can confidently say that nothing beats Tatte. There is a reason why it is so popular! However, I will argue that Blue Bottle Coffee has the most delicious coffee. I also love their branding and entire aesthetic! I love spending my weekends with friends and going out to sing and dance at a Karaoke. I would choose to go with a small group of friends that I vibe and enjoy with any day over a big group of people. I love traveling because learning comes naturally for me and I am always eager to learn more about the world. One day, I hope to be able to go solo traveling and take on new experiences. One thing on my bucket list is doing a real life Mario Kart race in Japan!
