<h2> Blue Bottle Coffee </h2>

    Once in a while, I think about this drink. I don’t know if it’s the branding, the presentation, or the ambiance and
    the entire experience of having this matcha, but it feels like a sunny, warm day. I would not say that the matcha
    itself is life changing or anything, but everything else surrounding it just seems to support it. The first sip
    feels very light, yet the subtle matcha flavor hits in the aftertaste. Because it is so light, it is almost watery,
    and depending on how I feel that day, I can either love it or hate it. The price, due to the company’s superb
    branding I must say, is quite expensive, but you gotta live a little sometimes. It is the perfect drink to regain
    focus and zen, pull up your laptop, and have a super productive day.

<h2> Matcha Maiko </h2>
<p>
    <h3> Cheese Foam Matcha Latte</h3>
    <img class="ani-image" src="matchamaiko.jpg" alt="Matcha Maiko Picture" title="Matcha Maiko Image">

            </ol>
        </li>

</p>

<p class="con">
    I ordered the cheese latte thinking that it will be a good balance of bitter and sweet. I loved the creamy blend
    of
    the latte and the matcha. However, it was a little too sweet for my liking. Matcha has a naturally bitter taste
    so
    if you top it with milk AND cheese, it takes a heavier twist to the mouth, leaving a unique aftertaste of bitter
    and
    sweet. They definitely added more flavor drops or sweeteners, but it didn't overpower the bitter taste of
    matcha. In terms of pricing, this was definitely more to the pricier end, especially for a medium cup. I think
    this would be perfect for matcha beginners or those who don’t really enjoy the raw bitterness of matcha!
    Overall, it was very creamy yet refreshing.

<h2> Tatte </h2>
<p>
    <h3> Iced Matcha Latte </h3>
    <img class="ani-image" src="tattematcha.jpg" alt="Tatte Matcha Picture" title="Tatte Matcha Image">
    <ul>

            </ol>
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p class="con">
    My first impression of the matcha was, “Oh, that is a very light… green.” I’ve always thought that a generous
    amount
    of matcha would reach a point where the drink looks dark enough, but not too dark; dark, but vibrant green. More
    so
    than the color, it often speaks to the quality of the drink which I explain in “Why Ceremonial Grade Matcha?”
    Although the drink was bitter, the taste of the milk overpowered everything else. However, I love that they
    don’t
    add any extra sugars, so people can adjust the sweetness to their own liking. As for me, I really enjoyed how
    light
    and refreshing this drink is and despite them being heavier on the milk ratio, it still felt energizing and
    delicious!

    <h3> Hot Matcha Latte </h3>
    <img class="ani-image" src="ogawacoffee.jpg" alt="Ogawa Matcha Picture" title="Ogawa Matcha Image">

</p>

<p class="con">
    I really enjoyed this matcha. This latte has a very grassy note, followed with a pleasant bitterness and a
    lingering sweetness at the end. While they offer both sweetened and unsweetened versions, I ordered the
    unsweetened. You can tell a good matcha just by ordering the original flavor, and this was definitely it. Also,
    bonus points for the cool latte art! I came here during the weekend, so they were really busy and couldn’t make
    animal art. So, come during the weekdays! They will be able to make cute little rabbits, hearts, and animal
    shaped foam latte art that you can post on your Instagram stories.

<h2> Machi Machi </h2>
<p>
    <h3> Panna Cotta Iced Matcha Latte </h3>
    <img class="ani-image" src="machimachi.jpg" alt="Machi Machi Picture" title="Machi Machi Image">

        </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p class="con">
    For a price like this, one would expect for the taste of matcha to be more prominent. However, this was very heavy
    on the sweetness that it overwhelms the taste of matcha. However, the matcha had grassy undertones after the sip,
    but the panna cotta adds a unique addition to the flavor and texture of the drink. Because you have to chew a little
    bit of the panna cotta, it leaves a “heavier” finish compared to other lattes, but I would recommend this to those
    who are just starting out to like matcha, or could enjoy matcha with boba and other topping options.

    It was surprisingly not as great as I expected. While the dessert was better, this one was a little underwhelming. Perhaps it was the sweetness that overpowered the authentic matcha taste. I suggest getting less sugar 30% or none at all because this was the default and it was too sweet for suggest getting less sugar 30% or none at all because this was the default and it was too sweet for 100%. I was a bit disappointed because it was trending on TikTok and IG reels, with all the food reviewers promoting how good it was. I say come for the desserts! It tastes amazing and I would recommend the matcha milk cap cake!
