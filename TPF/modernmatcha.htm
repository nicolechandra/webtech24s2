        <h3> Modernized Matcha</h3>
        <p>
            Going back to my story on how I discovered matcha, it is so interesting to see how other people have grown
            and
            discovered matcha on their own. Influencers are beginning to promote its health benefits, even creating
            their
            own brands and claiming it to be “ceremonial grade” and “organic.” I have my own opinions on this: these
            terms
            don’t mean anything as far as quality goes. Just because you label these as “organic” or “ceremonial grade,”
            matcha in itself already has health benefits that act as the default, so claims such as these make me
            wonder:
            what other things may these influencers be emphasizing that is not already in matcha? Food for thought.
            For example, I recently discovered Emma Chamberlain’s company, Chamberlain Coffee.

        <div id="emmachamb">
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C-2aMb-O7AE?si=XLY7JYli_wLJSCME"
                title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0"

        </div>
        <p>
            Although Emma has reinvented how people can make matcha at the comfort of their own home, the ever-evolving
            ritual of matcha is constantly changing. Now, Matcha has become a “hollywood” trend that is inspired by
            hashtags
            such as the #itgirlaesthetic or the #cleangirl lifestyle. Although often associated with health and “fit”
            lifestyles, some influencers use this opportunity to capitalize on their brand image. At the same time, I am
            glad that matcha is getting the recognition it deserves. However, I hope people are more conscious in their
            choice of purchase, ensuring that these are ethically sourced with respect to its roots and tradition.
        </p>

        <h3> What Changed?</h3>
        <p>
            In its production techniques, traditional methods of shading, picking, and grinding matcha have seen technological
            advancements. In the past, stone mills were used to grind the tea leaves slowly to avoid
            heating and preserve flavor, some modern producers use advanced machinery that can maintain low temperatures
            to achieve the same effect without the labor-intensive process.
        </br>
    </br>
            Although it was originally exclusive to Japan, matcha is now also cultivated in other countries like
            China and the U.S., adapting the traditional Japanese methods to different climates and soil conditions.
            As a result, its growing popularity worldwide only attracts more people to try this amazing antioxidant.
        </br>
    </br>
            Beyond the traditional tea ceremony, matcha is now used in a variety of food and
            beverages. It's a popular ingredient in lattes, smoothies, desserts, and even savory dishes, which has been
            facilitated by its global popularity and the influence of health and wellness trends.
