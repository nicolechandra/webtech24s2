	<h2> My Objective </h2>
	<p>The purpose of my website is to present a portfolio of my creative work through short films of everyday life.
		Whether it be short clips of my friends and I in college, or going cafe-hopping to explore the best matcha in
		town, this website will be curated to the feeling of nostalgia, music, and warmth: something that I want to
		illustrate through film. I will do this by having at least five short clips included with a short description of
		the moment. It will be something like a diary and the main goal is just to tell a story.
	</p>
	<br>
	<h2> My Website Target Audience</h2>
	<p> The target audience for my website could be film enthusiasts or those who seek comfort in storytelling. I want
		my portfolio to exude the feeling of “taking it slow”; home and comfort that is often not captured in everyday
		life. Because the films will mainly showcase food and human interactions, I hope my short films can attract a
		wide audience of food and film enthusiasts alike. In addition, I am hoping that I can use this project to
		showcase my skills in the future as I hope to get into the media and entertainment industry.
	</p>
	<br>
	<h2> My Content </h2>
	<p> Aside from my “About Me” page, I will have separated pages dedicated to different topics and emotions:</p>
	<br>

	<ul>
		<li> For The Love of Cinema (this will show the film and description, with some remarks about the mood and story)
				<li>Location</li>
				<li>Camera Specifications</li>
				<li> Movies that inspired me</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
<br>
		<li>For The Love of Food (this will show the film and description behind the foods and why it is comforting)

			<ul>
				<li>Location</li>
				<li>Camera Specifications</li>
				<li>Matcha and Coffee</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
<br>
		<li>For The Love of Adventure  (this will show the adventures and traveling I did during spring break and expresses the thrill of trying new things) 
			<ul>
				<li>Location</li>
				<li>Camera Specifications</li>
				<li> My bucket list</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
